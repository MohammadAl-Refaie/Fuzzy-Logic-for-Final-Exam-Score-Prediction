# Fuzzy-Logic-for-Final-Exam-Score-Prediction

A desktop application that predicts a student’s final exam grade using Fuzzy Logic (skfuzzy) and a Tkinter GUI. The prediction is based on three inputs by the user:

- Weekly study hours

- Previous exam grade

The system applies fuzzy membership functions and 27 rules to generate a realistic predicted score.
